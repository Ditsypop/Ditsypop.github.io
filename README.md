This site is a work in progress, eventually it'll be finished, but give us time to work on it. Here's a link if you'd like to visit it right now for any reason. (https://ditsypop.github.io)

# Work in Progress!
This site is nowhere near complete as we've just started to work on it. The individual pages will be available on the github if you'd like to see them seperately, and if you have any ideas or sugessions, tell us about it in issues please. After you submit a pull request Ditsy will take a look at it to see if it's up to par. Also, if you do decide to work on the site, the text has to be a variation of pink, her orders not mine.
